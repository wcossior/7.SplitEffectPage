# SplitEffectPage

The Split Effect Page is a web application that features a split layout with images on each side. The primary focus of the project is to implement an engaging hover effect where, upon hovering over one half, it expands horizontally, causing the other half to shrink. This effect creates a visually appealing and elegant dynamic.

## Features

- **Split Layout**: The webpage is divided vertically, showcasing images of PS5 and Xbox on either side.
- **Interactive Hover Effect**: Upon hovering over one side, that particular half expands horizontally, while the other half shrinks, creating an engaging visual effect.
- **Buy Now Buttons**: Each half includes a central "Buy Now" button, providing a clear call-to-action.

## How It Works

The project operates with the following principles:

1. **HTML Structure**: The layout structure, images, and buttons are defined in the HTML file.
2. **CSS Styling**: Initial styling, positioning, and the hover effect are implemented using CSS.
3. **JavaScript Hover Effect**: JavaScript is used to add the dynamic hover effect, adjusting the sizes of the halves upon user interaction.
